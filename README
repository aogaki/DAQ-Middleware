Notice:
According to "How to use GNU licenses for your own software"
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html.en>

    If you are releasing your program under the Lesser GPL, you should also
    include the text version of the LGPL, usually in a file called
    COPYING.LESSER. Please note that, since the LGPL is a set of additional
    permissions on top of the GPL, it's crucial to include both licenses so
    users have all the materials they need to understand their rights.

So we include both files (COPYING and COPYING.LESSER).
The License of DAQ-Middleware is GNU LGPL.
